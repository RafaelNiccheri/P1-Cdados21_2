# P1-Cdados21_2 (Classificador de tweets do Fantastico)
## Conta do tweeter @RNiccheri
#### Esquecemos de colocar docstring para as classes mas tds as funções tem ja.

## Nossa opinião sobre nosso projeto:
Por mais que o projeto ainda nao esteja completo, estamos contentes com o progresso realizado e o ritimo em que estamos sendo capazes de atualiza-lo.

## Branches:
Depois de ter terminado de escrever o codigo para a limpeza dos tweets iniciamos o processo de otimização do codigo. Ele consistia em passar por todas as funçaos e parametros globais das duas classes procurando semelhanças entre as Enherited functions de cada uma delas com o intuito de criar um decorando, uma funçáo ou um metodo global da classe que fosse capaz de executar esta parte semelhante para tds as funcões, deste modo diminuindo a memoria ocupada, o temanho do arquivo e o numero de linhas usadas. Para atingir este objetivo foi criado o branch Optimizing em que eram commitados todos os comits que nao adicionavam usuabilidades novas mas sim corrigiam/melhoravam/atualizavam usuabilidades colocadas em previos commits.

## My opinipon:
If you've never worked with a programing language this project will be a great entry point. It explains verry well the logic behind each line and expands on that by teaching in paralel how to properlly write your code respecting pythons "formating" guide-lines. Eventhought this project is easy for someone with a little of programing expirience it still teaches valuable python etiquette that programers should learn and aply from the start.

## Branches:
I wanted to creat two independent branches, one with the coppy of the folder I worked with and the other only with the .py files but wasnt able to. As it is right now I only need to delete the main branche and coppy this file the both of the independent branches.

## overall opinion:
- Project itself:
  - Targeted at people who have never programed or just started a few days or weeks ago
  - If you've learned the correct way to format your code they have a [PEP-8 code style mini course](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/5879) and  a [commenting mini course](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/6081). Things I hadn't lerned about before those two mini couses.
    - I'd never heard of [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) or any other type of coding stile guide books
    - I never knew the correct spacing between the code line and the comment or how to deal with big comments
  - If you know a little about programing but also haven't heard of those guideline both mini courses toghether wont take more then 20 minuts
  - It's easy to creat a connection between all the different things you're tought
  - The idea to turn all the the different benchmarks you reach into a final project gisves the sensation that what you learned was worth wile
  - As someone diagnosed with ADHD and ADD it's really gruelling to read all the theory presented wich led me to skip all of it exept for the PEP-8 one
- About the option to comit or not to [GitHub](https://github.com/):
  - I would do it even if only privately because it's a good way to keep track of your improvement
  - This being the first project for people who know nouthing about python it should have a walk through for commiting through JetBrains IDE.
    - I've used GitHub before but always have truble using it (specially to creat idependent branches) I could never do it. I already tried all methods I could find.
